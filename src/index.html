This index.html file exists because that's where <app-root> </app-root> exists. This is not html but rather where you tell the entire web application
to go in the first index.html file that you'd see in every website. It's pretty much always in the body.

The head tag is for the stuff that you won't see on the browser.
Base href="/" is the origin path that you'd see on the web address search bar and is used to determine the root point of your browser
as going through links are just going through file paths.

The meta tag is intended for determining the view size of the monitor/phone/tablet and is for the search engines.

<!-- HTMl is the static content portion of a website. It's where all the words displayed on a website come from and all that. -->

<!-- CSS refers to the "style" portion of a website. It allows you to make your website look nice and not like a website from 1995. -->

JavaScript is essentially the logic oriented portion of a website. It's what makes websites interactive to the user and makes a website enjoyable to go on.
Every single website these days have a lot of logic handling as it contributes to essential business functions and the UI/UX experience. 

TypeScript is basically JavaScript with all kinds of types (int, double, etc.. kind of like Rust & Go). Also, it has specialized types for the web too like 
different Event Handler types.

TypeScript exists because JS is ABSOLUTELY DETACHED from reality (seriously who thought arr[] = ['Dog', 6, '6', 8.9] was a good thing???)
and JS is known to produce the most buggy code in existence and ridiculous design patterns that could only be 
implemented in a language if it was designed by kindergardeners high on acid.

TS stops this by catching this stuff at runtime and event handling so you get errors instead of weird behaviors, buggy code, and it's generally more safe. 

You don't even have to implement manual checks for if the input is the correct type unlike in JS. 

Since TS is just JS with types, it's still compatible with JS.

It's important to remember that in the end, HTML, CSS, and JS/TS all work together to create a fully functional website.
